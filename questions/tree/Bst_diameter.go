// Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree
// and returns its diameter. The diameter of a
// binary tree is deï¿½ned as the length of its
// longest path, even if that path doesn't pass
// through the root of the tree.
// A path is a collection of connected nodes in a
// tree, where no node is connected to more
// than two other nodes. The length of a path is
// the number of edges between the path's ï¿½rst
// node and its last node.

// This is an input class. Do not edit.
